Originally set out to make Carcassonne Game with just the Castle pieces

# Technical Requirements
* Display a game in the browser
* Switch turns between two players, or switch turns between a player and the computer(AI)
* Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
* Use Javascript or JQuery for DOM manipulation
* Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

# Progress Pictures: 

## Planned Trello Board

![Mock Layout](./img/progress-pics/2.13.17-mock-layout.png)

## Day 2
Early drafts of the game. Use red border to get an idea of how elements will look around each other

![2nd Draft](./img/progress-pics/2.14.17-2nd-draft.png)

## Day 5
Progress after three days, mostly spent working on the javascript. Images and Meeples added. Slowly worked in elements such as buttons

# Technologies Used
* jquery
* sweetalerts

# Approach Taken
* Started by building a basic board
	* partial layout to look like markup
* Get a player turn locked down
	* New tiles & board dynamically generate
	* Tiles rotate and representated on both HTML and JS side
* Integrated graphics
	* Rotation to correctly reflect rotation
* Logic for castle completion
	* Had to change how I executed the function, led to re-coding tile representations in code


# Issues
* Learning jquery
* Getting rotations to reflect correctly, the tile is split into four divs that were rotating with the image rotation.
* activating/deactivating event listeners
* stuck on castle check for 3 days


# Fun Stuff
* Styling
* Refactoring 

# Unsolved Problems
* the algorithm that checks for connected castle pieces does not handle for two castles that are on a tile but are not connected. Because the algorithm returns on a broken castle, if one of the castles were not complete, the function would end before getting a chance to check the second castle.
* Check for comleted castles is buggy, large castles seem to believe they are complete and assign points before they are actually complete.

# Next Steps
* alert user of points received
* fix bugs
* add roads
* additional styling
