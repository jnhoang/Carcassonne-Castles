Process: 
Planned Trello Board:

![Page 2](./img/progress-pics/2.13.17-2.png)
![Mock Layout](./img/progress-pics/2.13.17-mock-layout.png)



technologies used: jquery, sweetalerts

approach taken
started by building a basic board

get a player turn locked down

stuck on castle check for 3 days

styling was fun
refactoring was fun

unsolved problems
the algorithm that checks for connected castle pieces does not handle for two castles that are on a tile but are not connected. Because the algorithm returns on a broken castle, if one of the castles were not complete, the function would end before getting a chance to check the second castle.
